# Alvin-Clemens-Portfolio-1.5

Built by Alvin Clemens

It was fun to go back and look at my code from only a few weeks ago, clearly I had to make some changes. I added a landing page to give the site a little more flow. Other then that all the inprovments have been for a quality of life. One such thing is adding the resume on the about me page, adding links to my social media pages, and actuly having project to showcase in my porfolio page. all the picture that are not in the swiper are clickable

I am exited to come back in a few more weeks to add more as I go.

How this works

1. You will enter the site on the landing page.
    -You can then go to my about me or profile using the clickable picutes or usung the nav bar.
2. Once you enter the about me page you can then read more about me, click on the resume and save or print it
3. Once you enter the portfolio page you can see all the projects and homeworks displayed and click on the links or on the pictures.
