So starting out on this project I have layed out daily goals. If the daily goal is meet and I feel the need to continue that will be the plan. My finnal notes are at the bottom. Engoy!

Day 1
7/26

    Goal of the day:
    I am looking to build the skeliton of the portfolio: 
                    
                    *Build out a rough outline of the homepage
                        *draw outline to have a viusal to work off of 
                    *Have the other pages linked to the home page with a working nave bar
                    *find pictures and videos that might be of use
                        during a break
                    *Pick up graph paper
                ** site wont go live on Git look into that


    Notes of the day: $$$=sucsess ???=what just happened @@@=code del and save slot ***=added objective

        $$$-Navbar is up and running added the pages  <href="./Homepage/portfoliopage.html"> to each page, this shows the navbar the location to send the page.

        ???-So im gonna link all the pages to hompage style sheet this could be nice but will see in the future if it messes anything up.
            $$-all linked, will see if I reget this 
        
        @@@- deleted word box could be used if i change my mind div class="badge badge-primary text-wrap" style="width: 100rem;">

        $$$-Video added to contacts page, just for fun 
            $$-centered video
                ??- vieos is centeder but it looks as if i did it the wrong way center is in red
            ???- so the video is reponcive but I need to find a way to drop it down I will look into also adding text above the video 

Contacts page
        **-so the text above the video looks good i need to work on the margins around the video and look at haveing the text fit into some smaller coloums rather then taking up 12 slots
        $?$- so i dont know if this is the best way to do this but i put in (<br><br>) to put in the break between the video and the text. 

All Pages
        **- I would like to find a way to move the icons on the nave bar to the left maybe make it a little biger as well
            *-line 17 on the home page had ML auto and the nav shifted right but the icons turned blue??? no clue why
            $$-still can not tell why it went blue but all is good now and back on track all nav bars are set to the right and and the same color.
        **-play with sizes of the pictures
            $$- so to work with the background you use background-size in the same

    Goals of the day:

        ** so we have the site up and running but i am missing a footer on the styles page and the contacts page
        ** i need to add a way to email me .... right? or i just leave it because i need to set the contacts page to send me there informantion.... that might be a later lesson 


        Notes of the day: $$$=secsess ???=what just happened @@@=code del and save slot ***=added objective
        
            ** Need to chang all of my bootstrap to xs per the read me section of the hw--- i thought that that wasnt needed in BS 4.5 but ill do it just in case 

        $$$- made my name a secondary home button.



        Final notes on the project:

            It was really fun putting the site together and finding way to break it again. At one point I had the site built out like the given Img's but in the end oppted for a diffrent formant. I also used text from a recent cover letter as a place holder until I have more projects under my belt. I honestly had a few hours where I thought I was crazy, for instance I spent over 3 hours working on the about me page picture trying to get it in the right place with the text bending around it. Then there were the issues with the navbar that would work on VS code but on a live page would not. Funny story at one point it would work going from home to contact but not back, it would get stuck on profile and not go anywhere even tho it worked going down and not back up.

            Also little hiden feacher is the Alvin Clemens works as a second home button so go ahead and us that. I know the code looks ugly and i have it closed up but it works, I am planning on building another page as practice so that I can refine and clean my code. Hope you enjoy the pictures and the videos, again they are just place holders until I have more work. Now on to the next project.
